      <h3>An Easy Way To Change Uppercase to Lowercase And Title Capitalization</h3>
      <p>Have you ever typed out a document, made a few capitalization mistakes and wished you won't have to waste much time editing? It happens a lot, and if you are using a typical word processing tool, you will have your mistakes autocorrected as you type, but those kinds of software only correct grammatical errors. If you have to capitalize on a whole portion, you will need to do it manually. And that takes time. However, with an online text transforming tool like ours, you can easily transform the case of your texts. All you have to do is copy and paste your text, then select the case you want to transform it to.
